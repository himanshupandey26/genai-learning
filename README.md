# 🤖 My Generative AI Course Projects

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey through the **Generative AI Recorded Course**. It contains all the code, notes, and hands-on projects I am building as I progress from Python basics to advanced AI applications.

## 📚 What I'm Learning

This course covered a wide range of topics. Here are the main technologies I learned to use:
*  **🐍 Python Basics:** Mastering variables, loops, functions, and general coding fundamentals.
*   **📊 Statistics Basics:** Key concepts necessary for ML like mean, median, mode, and Bayes’ Theorem.
*   **🌐 Building Web Apps:** Using **Streamlit** to create interactive front-ends for my models.
*   **🤖 Machine Learning (ML):** Pattern recognition using **scikit-learn** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
*   **🧠 Deep Learning (DL):** Building neural networks with **TensorFlow** (ANN, CNN, RNN models).
*   **🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Tokenization, stemming, TF-IDF, and teaching machines to understand text.
*   **🔗 LangChain:** The framework for connecting LLMs to external data sources (PDFs, CSVs) and memory.
*   **🏗️ Transformers:** Deep dive into the architecture powering modern LLMs like GPT-4.
*   **🗄️ Vector Databases:** Using **ChromaDB** for efficient AI data storage and retrieval.
*   **✨ Prompt Engineering:** Advanced strategies like Zero-Shot and Few-Shot prompting.
*   **💬 LLMs:** Hands-on with **Llama 2**, **Gemini**, and **OpenAI** APIs.
