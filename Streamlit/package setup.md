 **Ubuntu 24.04**
Basically, Ubuntu now **protects the system Python** from direct `pip install` commands to prevent breaking built-in packages.

Let’s fix this cleanly 👇

---

### 🩵 Option 1 (Recommended): Use a Virtual Environment

This is the *safest* and cleanest way.

#### Step-by-step:

```bash
# 1. Install venv if not already
sudo apt install python3-venv -y

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# 3. Activate it
source myenv/bin/activate

# 4. Now install Streamlit safely inside the env
pip install streamlit
```

✅ Done!
Now you can run Streamlit apps like this:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

And to exit the environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

### 🩶 Option 2 (Quick & Dirty): Force Install (Not Recommended)

If you *really* want to install globally:

```bash
pip install streamlit --break-system-packages
```

But warning ⚠️ — this might mess with Ubuntu’s system Python over time.

---

### 🧠 Bonus Tip:

If you plan to use multiple Python tools (like Streamlit, OpenAI, FastAPI, etc.), it’s better to use:

```bash
pipx install streamlit
```

(but first install `pipx` using `sudo apt install pipx`)
